# Overview

This was my first experience doing mobile app development.
I used this project to familiarize myself with the process of creating a simple android app.

I created a simple to-do list app.
Clicking the `Add` button in the main view will add a new task to your list from the text box.
Clicking the `Finish` button will remove tasks from your list that have been checked off.

I created this app as a simple way to create a to-do list with minimal UI getting in the way.

# Development Environment

I created this app in Android Studio.
It extends the Empty Views Activity project template.

I programmed this using only Kotlin and the traditional Android views system.

# Future Work

* Make the tasklist persistent across separate launches
* Create a custom app icon
* Personalize the UI theme
